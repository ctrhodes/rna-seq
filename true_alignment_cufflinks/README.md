#Transcript abundance quantified by cufflinks

This scripts in this repository provide a basic workflow for aligning paired-end RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using "true alignment" methods. We will use the Tuxedo Suite of programs (bowtie, cufflinks, cuffdiff, etc) to quantify transcript abundance.
